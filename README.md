## Demo: Chatbot as a Cook üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥

Imagine wanting to learn how to prepare specific dishes. 
I've discovered a fantastic collection of recipes written in Markdown 
from [this outstanding repository](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Recipes/tree/master).
(All recipes, formatted as Markdown files, are housed within the `recipes` directory of this project.)
Although the collection is vast, 
I prefer NOT to sift through each recipe manually. 
This chatbot offers a solution.

In this demonstration, the chatbot takes on the role of a chef well-versed in a myriad of recipes. 
I can effortlessly inquire about the preparation of any particular dish.
